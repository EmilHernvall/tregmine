Zone mapper tool
================

Outputs maps for all tregmine zones.

This tool uses source code taken from the dynmap project, which is licensed
under the Apache license. Thus, so is this part of the tregmine project. Most
of the code here is freshly written, but certain parts such as textures and
color schemes would have required significant labor to duplicate what dynmap
has already done better, and thus it's also used here.

Minor aspects of the code such as the multi-layer alpha blending has also been
borrowed to some extent.
